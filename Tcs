postman script to check error handling test cases for API

Here is an example of how you might use Postman to test error handling for an API:

Create a new request in Postman and set the method to GET.

Enter the endpoint for the resource you want to test, for example, http://api.example.com/users

In the Headers tab, add the Authorization header with a valid token, if required.

Send the request and check the response status code. It should be 200 OK, if the request is valid.

Now, change the endpoint to an invalid one, for example, http://api.example.com/invalid and send the request again.

Check the response status code. It should be 404 Not Found, indicating that the endpoint is invalid.

Next, try sending a request with an invalid parameter, for example, http://api.example.com/users?id=abc

Check the response status code. It should be 400 Bad Request, indicating that the parameter is invalid.

Try sending a request with a missing required parameter, for example, http://api.example.com/users?page=2

Check the response status code. It should be 400 Bad Request, indicating that a required parameter is missing.

Try sending a request with an expired token, for example, http://api.example.com/users?token=expired

Check the response status code. It should be 401 Unauthorized, indicating that the token is expired

Repeat the above steps for other error handling scenarios you want to test, such as exceeding the rate limit or sending malformed requests.

It's worth noting that this is a basic example and the actual implementation can be more complex depending on the API and the error handling.
